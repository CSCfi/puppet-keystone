fixes:
  - |
    The ``default/public_endpiint`` parameter is no longer set by default
    because of known issue with different hosts/protocol used for each
    endpoints (especially for admin endpoint and public endpoint)
  - |
    In case public_endpoint can't be used and keystone providers are required,
    the deprecated ``keystone::public_bind_host`` and ``keystone::public_port``
    can still be used so that all provider implementations can detect endpoint
    url from these parameters. These parameters are added to keystone.conf
    if non-default value is set.
